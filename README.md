# shelby-handfield-portfolio
Creating a working portfolio about myself, Shelby. This is a living article that will showcase my strengths. I have created a index, contact, and portfolio section. These all connect via buttons. 
There is also a style.css to assist with giving the portfolio the styling that I want.
