    <h1> Here's Some things about me!</h1>
    
      <p>My name is Bulma! If you are a nerd then you know where my name is from. If not let me bark it out to ya! My name comes from the amazing anime series Dragon Ball which Dragon Ball Z follows and a few other Dragon Ball Series. I am a little red husky, about 60% actually! My mom did a DNA test on me and I am also part lab, hound dog and hunting dog. My short stature is also due to part of my family tree, so you could say I am a perma pup. I am a daddy's girl and love to play with him, snuggle, go on car rides and hikes. I also love my mom too, since she babysits me every day. She sunbathes with me, gives me belly rubs, we play and also hike as a family. My pawrents adopted me from the Dumb Friends League in Castle Rock. The moment we met, I knew they were my furever family. </p>
     
      <p>I have three furry best friends and two Uncles and one Aunt! Sasha is my all time favorite though,don't tell the others! She is 100% husky and like a fur mom to me. My Uncle Rich is her dad, and I love him too especially when we cuddle! Ginger is my other best friend she is part husky and chow. She might be a little smaller then me but she is like my big sister. She has taught me a lot about play etiquette at the house and at the parks! She is also bright orange, hence her name! Her dad is my Uncle Cam, and he is pretty cool dude. My third best friend and also furry father is Henley. He is a mix of breeds, just like me! We have a lot of the same ancestory though. My Auntie Missa is his mom, and I love giving her kisses. Sasha, Ginger, Henley and I all love to play, but sometimes Ginger likes to sunbath. I am also learning a lot of tricks and etiquette still.</p>

      <p>I think all other dogs should be my new friends, and I have a very loud howl/bark. My pawrents get mad cause it kind of sounds like I am dying with how loud and sharp I can cry/howl. I think I am talking, but the pawrents do not think so. I can sit, shake, lay down and stay when I want to. I am a husky, so I am very proud, stubborn and can have some attitude. My dad and mom still love me anyways. They always give me lots of kisses, belly rubs, cuddles and make sure that I go to bed with a full tummy. I do fully enjoy to tear and rip apart my toys, and I would like more but they have not given me any new ones. I just keep getting bones, which I also love. My pawrents say I am too young, since I am only a year and two months, to have a snapchat, instagram, or facebook. I don't even have a pawmail!</p>
    
      <p>If you happen to find me, cause I LOVE TO JUMP FENCES, please complete the contact form as it will be sent directly to my mom. Also, life is ruff when you're cute as fluff, so I added a few pictures. </p>
